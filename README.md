# CryptoPunks GAN Project 🚀

👋 Welcome to the CryptoPunks GAN project! This project utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks to generate unique and exciting variations of CryptoPunks, a popular NFT dataset.

## What is CryptoPunks?

CryptoPunks are one of the first NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain. These 24x24 pixel art characters have taken the crypto world by storm, and we're here to explore their creative potential with GANs.

## DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network)

DCGAN is a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that uses deep convolutional neural networks for image generation tasks. It excels in generating high-quality images.

### How DCGAN Was Used in This Project

In this project, we harnessed the power of DCGAN to create unique CryptoPunks variations. The DCGAN model was trained on the CryptoPunks dataset, learning the patterns and features of these pixel art images.

## Features ✨

- 🎨 Generate Unique Punks: Create one-of-a-kind CryptoPunks using the power of GANs.
- 🤖 Easy-to-Use: Get started quickly with our user-friendly interface.

## Usage 💡

- Use this project to explore creative variations of CryptoPunks.
- Experiment with different GAN architectures and training parameters.
- Share your unique CryptoPunk creations with the world!
